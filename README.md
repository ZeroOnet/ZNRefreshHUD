#ZNRefreshHUD

This is a loosely coupled drop-down refresh simple Demo！Because of the lack of ability，the result did not reach the expected value。This design is the starting point in reading App seen above,of course, many Apps alse used this framework。

Swizzling Method is the main key of realizing the function!

In fact, I want to look for some help here to fully implement this design！If you take the trouble, you can download the Demo and see where the author encountered problems (these problems are not easy to describe）,and then provide me with some ways to resolve.Before this, I sincerely thank you!
